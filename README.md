# Go Dungeon
This is a new project to build a better version of this project: (https://github.com/AGoodnight/ES6-ddgrid-frontend)

The ddgrid project demonstrated how we can have a kotlin graphql server drive a js frontend. However GraphQL is not the ideal solution for a project of this size, further kotlin is also overkill because we do not use any Java libraries that can't be replaced.

So this project aims to redo that project with a lighter backend solution using GO.
